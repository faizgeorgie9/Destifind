# Destifind

Destifind is a project developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course in my second semester.  
This project was designed to strengthen my understanding of how data structures and algorithms are applied to solve problems efficiently and systematically.

## Project Overview
The main focus of Destifind is the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithmic concepts. Through this project, I explored how different data structures organize data and how algorithms process that data to achieve optimal performance.

This project serves as a transition from basic programming concepts to more structured, algorithm-oriented problem solving.

## Key Concepts Implemented
- Arrays and basic data manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Tree structures and traversal
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Basic analysis of time complexity

## Objectives
- To fulfill the requirements of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course
- To apply theoretical concepts into a functional program
- To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- To understand the importance of efficiency and structured program design

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Development Environment: **VS Code**
- Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms, Logical Problem Solving

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- How data structures affect program performance
- The role of algorithms in optimizing solutions
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable, and structured code
- Thinking algorithmically when approaching a problem

## Notes
This project was developed during my second semester as part of my academic coursework.  
While it reflects my learning stage at that time, it also represents an important milestone in my growth as a programmer.
